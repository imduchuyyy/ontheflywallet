There are always 2 problems I face when I store my cryptocurrency in a wallet:

- Hacker can attack my device and steal my private keys
- I can lose my private keys and lose access to my funds forever

This fun project aims to solve both problems.

- Private keys are not stored on my device, but rather generated on the fly when needed.
- Using custom mnemonic phrases that are easy to remember, I can always recover my private keys.

I use this to study rust also. Enjoy!
